BillWise is a modern invoicing SaaS platform that lets users create, send, and manage invoices with ease. It streamlines payment tracking, supports client management, and provides real-time insights into revenue and billing activity.

## The Problem
For years, invoicing non-EU bookings at my hotel has been a pain. Spreadsheets everywhere, manually tweaked Word docs, folders full of PDFs, and a growing list of reminders to follow up. It was clunky, time-consuming, and easy to mess up.

So I finally thought:
ðŸ‘‰ Why not build something that actually works for me??

So I did!
